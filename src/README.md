## Node.js refactoring code

This is a Node.js project that demonstrates refactoring code from callbacks to Promises and Async/Await for better readability and error handling.

## Getting Started

### Files

- `callback.js`: Original callback-based implementation
- `index.js`: Refactored implementation using Promises and Async/Await
- `input.txt`: Input file containing sample data
- `output.txt`: Output file generated after processing

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prestigious-protagonist/Week-3.git
   npm install
   node src/index.js
   node src/callback.js

   - This generates an output.txt with content copied to it from input.txt
   ```
